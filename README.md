## Overview of Analysis
For this project I had to change the tripduration column from an integer to a datetime datatype before I could start the visualization process in tableau. Once that was finished I then went to get my updated data into tableau to create the 5 new visualizations which are listed here:
- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
## Results
1. This is a line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, and the graph can be filtered by the hour.

5. This is a heatmap that is showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, and you can only filter by user and gender.

7. This is a horizantal bar chart that shows the peak hours of number of rides in August.

## Summary
This is the link to my story:
[[link to dashboard]((https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/holden.b.lauer/viz/CitiBikeChallenge_16685424053890/CitiBikeStory?publish=yes))](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/holden.b.lauer/viz/CitiBikeChallenge_16685424053890/CitiBikeStory?publish=yes)

From the results I can tell that a majority of our customers are male. Also, about 80% of customers are subscribed. The most frequent riding times are in the morning and afternoon (like 6 AM to 9AM and 4PM to 7PM). With that our heatmap also shows that the weekend is much busier than the weekdays.
Two additional visualizations for further analysis:
1. Get the gender count for subscriber to non-subscribed to see which gender tends to subscribe more.
2. Could create a map that shows the top stations with the income overlay to show if income has an effect on the amount of riders.
